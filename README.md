# bikesharing 🚲 🚴‍♀️ 🚴‍♂️

## Overview of the analysis: 

After a trip to NYC there is a potential idea of starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines. There is a potention investor that is willing to provide funding to explore the bike-sharing program in Des Moines. The mechanics of making this program work will begin by first analyzing how the bika-sharing program works in NYC. 

## ⚪ Results: 


##  🟢 Summary: 

In New York City there are more male users that utilize the bike-sharing program. 

The results also show that people tend to use the bikes within certian times. Early in the morning between 7 am - 9am and in the evening between 5 pm - 7pm

I would suggest a visualization that displays the reason for usage, are people using the bike-sharing program to commute to work or for leisure? 
Secondly, I would recommend a visualization that displays the proximity of the placements of the bikes in comparison to the locations of tourist locations.
